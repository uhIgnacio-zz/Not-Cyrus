To gain privacy, first you have to figure out what you want to lose and base your threat scale off everyday attacks, total privacy online is NOT possible. The goal to privacy is to make it hard for people like ad companies, governments to know EVERYTHING about what you do online. So, use this more of a list of cool services with their positives and negatives than an actual guide you should follow down to the letter.

Services:
    Browsers:
        Notes
            - The easiest browser with no setup is Tor. If you truly care about privacy to the fullest extent I would recommend that.
        Requirements
            - Open source
            - Minimal tracking by simply using the browser
        Firefox
            - At it's default settings it is basically just as bad as chrome.
            - Easy to FIX however via https://ffprofile.com/ or https://github.com/arkenfox/user.js, these WILL break some sites so tweak them how you feel is better for you.
            - Good addon list
        Tor
            - At it's default settings it is the most private
            - Routes all of your traffic through 3 different servers
            - Able to switch your security level on the fly
            - Blocked by most sites (That's where the other 2 come in!)
            - More Captchas
            - Some sites protected by cloudflare don't work at all
        Ungoogled chromium
            - It's basically just chrome but without googles grasp, if you like chrome then you'll probably like this
    
    Chat clients:
        Requirements
            - Open source Client & protocol
            - Little to no metadata unless specified otherwise
            - E2E
        Briar https://code.briarproject.org/briar/briar
            - Tor routing
            - P2P
            - Probably the most secure in this list but comes with the cost of usability
        Element (Matrix is the protocol) https://element.io/
            - Have to setup a server yourself (or use a public one)
            - Has a bit of metadata, used to be funded by an israeli ISP which was known for metadata collection
            - You have to half-trust public servers to not misuse your metadata
        Signal https://signal.org/
            - requires a phone number to signup
            - Easier to use
        Gajim (XMPP is the protocol) https://gajim.org/
            - Kinda ugly but gajim 1.4 looks cool
            - Minimal to no metadata (This is more of on the protocol than gajim)
            - Able to route through tor very easily (with gajim atleast)
            - NOT E2E encrypted by default.

    Email Forwarder/Services:
        Notes
            - To use these effectively you NEED to use multiple different emails for different things
        Requirements

            - Some type of encryption unless specified otherwise

            - Not open source I believe BUT very open in their policies
            - Invite only so you need to know someone who has it
            - Able to delete your emails off their servers (supposedly) so you can make sure they sit on them for very little time.

        Gmail https://gmail.com
            - Does NOT have an onion url

Other mentionable notes:
    - Turning off gps / Try to use WiFi as little as possible is a good start
    - SMS / Email are inheritely insecure, do not use them for sending sensitive data.
    - Social medias track you, if you have to use them then use them as little as you can/use alternatives or use their web versions if they exist.
    - If you like to use youtube use newpipe or freetube instead (They scrape off youtube but store everything locally and stop tracking cookies.)
